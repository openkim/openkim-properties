  "property-title" "Relaxed formation potential energy of a monovacancy in a crystal at zero temperature and applied stress"

  "property-description" "Relaxed potential energy of formation of a monovacancy in a (possibly multispecies) infinite host crystal at zero temperature and applied stress relative to a given infinite elemental reference crystal ('reservoir'). The host structure is expressed as an AFLOW prototype label and its corresponding free parameters. The reservoirs for each constituent element are specified in terms of their prototype label only. Monovacancies for all unique Wyckoff sites are computed."

Each row corresponds to a structure in the test, i.e. a test computing a property of a single crystal will only have one row, while something like a transformation between two pre-determined crystals would have two rows, and so on. Within each row, there may be multiple columns in the case when multiple initial structures converged to a single final structure during this test or one of its upstream dependencies. Because KIM Property values must be regular arrays, rows will be padded with empty strings to match the longest row."
