  "property-description" "Cohesive energy and stability versus first Piola-Kirchhoff (nominal) shear stress path under stress control boundary conditions for a cubic crystal at zero absolute temperature.  The applied nominal shear stress is defined by a shearing direction and shear plane normal relative to the reference conventional crystal coordinate system."
