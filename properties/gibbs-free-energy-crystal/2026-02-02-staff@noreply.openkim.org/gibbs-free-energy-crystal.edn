  "property-title" "Gibbs free energy of an abritrary crystal at constant temperature and stress state"

  "property-description" "Gibbs free energy of an arbrary crystal at constant temperature and stress state. The crystal structure is expressed as an AFLOW prototype label and its corresponding free parameters. The reported Gibbs free energy is defined as the Gibbs free energy of the crystal less the potential energy of the isolated constituent particles.\n\n
  Three values are reported, the `gibbs-free-energy-per-atom` is the average Gibbs free energy per atom in the unit cell, the `gibbs-free-energy-per-formula` is the Gibbs free energy per chemical formula, which reflects the relative ratio of elements in the primitive unit cell of the crystal, and the `specific-gibbs-free-energy` which is the Gibbs free energy per unit of mass. For a crystal containing a single chemical element (regardless of structure) the `-per-atom` and `-per-formula` values are the same, e.g. for hcp Mg the chemical formula is Mg and the 'gibbs-free-energy-per-formula' is per magnesium atom (even though the hcp primitive unit cell contains two atoms). For compounds the 'gibbs-free-energy-per-formula' will depend on the stoichiometric formula, e.g. for MoS_2 (AB2-type compound) the free energy is per MoS_2 unit (i.e. 3 times larger than the `gibbs-free-energy-per-atom` value)."

Each row corresponds to a structure in the test, i.e. a test computing a property of a single crystal will only have one row, while something like a transformation between two pre-determined crystals would have two rows, and so on. Within each row, there may be multiple columns in the case when multiple initial structures converged to a single final structure during this test or one of its upstream dependencies. Because KIM Property values must be regular arrays, rows will be padded with empty strings to match the longest row."
