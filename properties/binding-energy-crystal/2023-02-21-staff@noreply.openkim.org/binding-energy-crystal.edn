  "property-title" "Equilibrium crystal structure and binding potential energy at zero temperature and applied stress"

  "property-description" "Equilibrium structure and energy of a crystal at zero temperature and applied stress. The equilibrium structure is expressed as an AFLOW prototype label and its corresponding free parameters. The equilibrium may be stable or unstable (not reported in this property). Multiple instances of this property with different free parameters may be reported for a given AFLOW prototype label, representing different stable or unstable equilibria. There is no guarantee that any instance of this property is the ground state of this system, not even when the configuration space is restricted to the specified crystal prototype label.\n\n
  The reported binding potential energy is the energy required to decompose the solid into its individual constituent particles isolated from each other. This is defined as the energy of the crystal less the energies of the isolated constituent particles. \n\n
  Two values are reported, the `binding-potential-energy-per-atom` is the average energy per atom in the unit cell, the `binding-potential-energy-per-formula` is the energy per chemical formula, which reflects the relative ratio of elements in the primitive unit cell of the crystal. For a crystal containing a single chemical element (regardless of structure) this is the same as the `binding-potential-energy-per-atom`, e.g. for hcp Mg the chemical formula is Mg and the 'binding-potential-energy-per-formula' is per magnesium atom (even though the hcp primitive unit cell contains two atoms). For compounds the 'binding-potential-energy-per-formula' will depend on the stoichiometric formula, e.g. for MoS_2 (AB2-type compound) the energy is per MoS_2 unit (i.e. 3 times larger than the `binding-potential-energy-per-atom` value). The reported energies are actual energies (not the negative of the energy as commonly reported), therefore these values will be negative for a crystal that is more stable than its isolated constituents."
