  "property-title" "Surface energy for a cubic crystal"

  "property-description" "A surface (free) energy of a cubic monoatomic crystal at a specified hydrostatic stress and temperature. If computed, this corresponds to the 'relaxed' surface energy found by performing an energy minimization. At zero temperature, the calculation is for the potential energy as opposed to the free energy."
